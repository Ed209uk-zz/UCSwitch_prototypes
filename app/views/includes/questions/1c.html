<p class="bold-small">What if I care for a child or Iâ€™m a carer?</p>
<p>You will not need a Claimant Commitment if you have a child under one or have
  significant caring responsibilities for someone. There are separate categories
  for children up to 3 years old. Once they are 3 or over you will be expected to
  look for full-time work.
